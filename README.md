**Here is the /r/PiratedGames Megathread!** - [Translations](translations)
---

### Needed Components:
You will need to install all of these before downloading any (legitimate or pirated) games to stop crashing due to missing software on your computer:

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35)

### Torrent Sites:
You will likely need a VPN to download torrents to avoid receiving copyright notices from your ISP, unless your country does not care about piracy. Read more in the VPN section further in this thread. Torrents are P2P downloads: You download from other people who have downloaded the file. No servers are involved.

### Direct Download Sites:
Direct downloads are any normal download: You download the file from a server through a browser. It is significantly safer to download this way and you will not need a VPN. You will need a VPN to access blocked filehost sites (for example, ZippyShare is blocked in some EU countries) in some cases. It is recommended to use a download manager mentioned further down the megathread to help managing your downloads.
