**Here's the /r/PiratedGames Mega Thread!** - [translations](translations/)
---

### Required Components:
You will need to install all of these before downloading any games (legitimate or pirated!) to stop games crashing due to missing software on your computer:

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
- [VisualCppRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/latest)
- [XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)

### Torrent Sites:
You will likely need a VPN to download torrents to avoid receiving Copyright notices from your ISP - unless, your country does not care about piracy. Read more in the VPN section further in this thread. Torrents are P2P downloads - you download from other people who have downloaded the file. No servers are involved.

- [1337X](https://1337x.to/) - Do not download torrents uploaded by IGG games.

- [RuTor](http://www.rutor.info/)
- [RuTracker](https://rutracker.org)
- [Rustorka](http://rustorka.com/)
- [Tapochek](https://tapochek.net/index.php)

### Direct Download Sites:
Direct Downloads are any normal download. You download the file from a server through a web browser. It is significantly safer to download this way and you will not need a VPN. In some cases, you will need a VPN to access blocked filehost sites (e.g. ZippyShare is blocked in some EU countries). It is recommended to use a Download Manager mentioned further down the Mega Thread to help manage your downloads.
