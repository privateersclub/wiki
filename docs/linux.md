# Linux

Everything regarding piracy on Linux.

::: info Best Linux distribution for Gaming?
None. None of them will provide you the performance they claim that you can't get yourself by picking a regular distribution and using latest updates.

So to get the best performance, one simply needs the latest updates. All linux distributions provide the sames packages and provide updates. Some provide them faster than others. So any distribution that updates its packages the soonest after upstream, is good in our opinion.

::: danger Beware of what you search/read online!
Beware of what you search and read online on the internet, it's the general rule that one should't believe everything they see online.

Not everything will work out the way you intend *it may work*, sometimes the advice online is outdated or just **incompatible**, so be sure of what you're seeing will work for your system or not, before running any commands or changing configurations, and breaking your system in the process.

If you need a guide, the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is good and works universally for most distributions, not only arch.

## Software

### Kernels

::: danger
Custom kernels can significantly change your system behavior, [disable security mitigations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters), and cause all sorts of instablities and reliablity issues. It is recommended that you keep [backups](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Backup) and a backup kernel installed to boot back to, from GRUB.
