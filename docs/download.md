# Download

Sites and everything for direct downloads.

## Direct Download Sites

Direct downloads are normal downloads from a server, being safer and not
requiring a VPN. You may need a VPN to access blocked file hosts (like
Rapidgator in some EU countries). Check the
[download managers section](/software#download-managers) for help managing
your downloads.

## Torrent Sites

Torrents are P2P downloads from other users, without servers. You will need a VPN
to torrent safely and avoid ISP copyright notices, unless your country tolerates
piracy. Check the [VPNs section](/software#vpns) for more info.

## Repacks

Repacks are compressed games for low-bandwidth users, but installing them takes
time due to file decompression.
