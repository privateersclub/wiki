# Direct download sites

Direct downloads are normal downloads from a server, being safer and not requiring a VPN. You may
need a VPN to access blocked file hosts (like Rapidgator in some EU countries). Check the
[download managers section](software.md#download-managers) for help managing your downloads.

# Torrent sites

Torrents are P2P downloads from other users, without servers. You will need a VPN to torrent safely
and avoid ISP copyright notices, unless your country tolerates piracy. Check the
[VPNs section](software.md#vpns) for more info.
