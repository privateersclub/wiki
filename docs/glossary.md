# Glossary

This page helps summarize over some basic topics on the piracy scene. This also
serves as referential material to gloss over quickly.

## Terms

:::tip What is the Scene? And P2P?
The Scene is an underground community of
people who crack and share copyrighted material. They have strict rules that all
scene members have to abide. P2P are independent crackers who don't follow the
[Scene rules](https://scenerules.org).
:::

:::tip Whatâ€™re NFOs?
NFOs are like a readme.txt that Scene makes on release. It
gives you instructions, a general description of the game and some additional
information.

:::tip Why does X site have so many ads?
**Use an adblocker**. Ads keep the
websites running, but sometimes the ad ruins the experience or even link
malware. You can take these steps if you want an ad-free experience:

### Android

Install
[**Firefox**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)
and add
[**uBlock Origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/ublock-origin).
This should be more than enough. If you want system-wide support, try
[**AdGuard**](https://adguard.com/adguard-android/overview.html) or
[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io). You can watch
[**this video**](https://youtu.be/WUG57ynLb8I) if you need guidance.

### PC

Install [**uBlock Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com) in your browser and you're
done! If you want a system-wide solution, you _can_ use
[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io), but it won't be as effective as uBlock
Origin. You can also use
[Bypass All Shortlinks](https://codeberg.org/Amm0ni4/bypass-all-shortlinks-debloated)
or [Bypass.city](https://bypass.city) to _bypass_ redirects.

### iOS

[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io) should cover everything for system-wide ads &
trackers. You can also try [**AhaDNS**](https://ahadns.com).

:::tip Do I need to use VPN while downloading?
The necessity of using a VPN
depends on the method of downloading. For direct downloads, a VPN is typically
unnecessary. However, if you're engaging in peer-to-peer (P2P) activities such
as torrenting, it is advisable to employ a VPN for enhanced security and
privacy. Additionally, the legal ramifications in your area play a crucial role;
if the consequences are lenient, you might opt to forgo using a VPN altogether.

:::tip Why is my download so slow? 
Use a download manager. Some websites impose
file transfer limits for a single thread, thereby restricting download speeds.
Download managers overcome this limitation by leveraging multiple threads for
downloading, resulting in faster download speeds. We've listed some recommended
ones [here](/software#download-managers).
