This page helps summarize over some basic topics on the piracy scene.
This also serves as
referential material to gloss over quickly.

## Terms

::: tip What is the Scene? And P2P?
The Scene is an underground community of people who crack and
share copyrighted material. They have strict rules that all scene members have to abide. P2P are
independent crackers who don't follow the [Scene rules](https://scenerules.org).
:::

::: tip What’re NFOs?
NFOs are like a readme.txt that Scene makes on release. It gives you
instructions, a general description of the game and some additional information.

::: tip Why does X site have so many ads?
**Use an adblocker**. Ads keep the websites running, but
sometimes the ad ruins the experience or even link malware. You can take these steps if you want an
ad-free experience:

### Android

Install [**Firefox**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) and add
[**uBlock Origin**](https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/ublock-origin). This should be more
than enough. If you want system-wide support, try
[**AdGuard**](https://adguard.com/adguard-android/overview.html) or
[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io). You can watch [**this video**](https://youtu.be/WUG57ynLb8I) if
you need guidance.

### PC

Install [**uBlock Origin**](https://ublockorigin.com) in your browser and you're done! If you want a
system-wide solution, you _can_ use [**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io), but it won't be as effective
as uBlock Origin. You can also use [Bypass All Shortlinks](https://codeberg.org/Amm0ni4/bypass-all-shortlinks-debloated)
or
[Bypass.city](https://bypass.city) to _bypass_ redirects.

### iOS

[**NextDNS**](https://nextdns.io) should cover everything for system-wide ads & trackers. You can
also try [**AhaDNS**](https://ahadns.com).

::: tip Do I need to use VPN while downloading?
The necessity of using a VPN depends on the method
of downloading. For direct downloads, a VPN is typically unnecessary. However, if you're engaging in
peer-to-peer (P2P) activities such as torrenting, it is advisable to employ a VPN for enhanced
security and privacy. Additionally, the legal ramifications in your area play a crucial role; if the
consequences are lenient, you might opt to forgo using a VPN altogether.

::: tip Why is my download so slow?
Use a download manager. Some websites impose file transfer
limits for a single thread, thereby restricting download speeds. Download managers overcome this
limitation by leveraging multiple threads for downloading, resulting in faster download speeds. We've listed some
recommended ones [here](useful.md).
