## Untrusted sites and uploaders

You can just use
the [FMHY Unsafe Sites/Software](https://fmhy.net/unsafesites) [adblock filter](https://windowsaurora.github.io/FMHYFilterlist/site/index.html)
on uBlacklist (more efficient) or uBlock Origin to block most of the sites mentioned here and more. Follow
[this guide](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs/advanced-features#subscription) to add the
custom filter to uBlacklist (put
[this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/privateersclub/wiki/master/unsafe_uBlacklist.txt)
under "URL") and
[this guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WindowsAurora/FMHYFilterlist/main/filterlist.txt)
to add it to uBlock Origin (use
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WindowsAurora/FMHYFilterlist/main/filterlist.txt) under
"Import…").
