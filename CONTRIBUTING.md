# Contributing

There are various ways you can contribute to the project:

- Submissions (Software, sites, useful content)
- Translations

We use [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) for our site generation so you will need a working Node.js enviornment installed.
See its docs on how to make changes to Vitepress itself.
`docs/` is the root directory.

All content resides on the `docs/wiki/` folder in the repository.
Translations are currently unsupported because I still can't figure it out so it resides in the old `translations` folder.
